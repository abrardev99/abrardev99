### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm a web dev and maker.

I am a full-stack PHP Laravel developer. From a very early age I've been fascinated with computers, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Later, I fell in love with web development 
and never looked back. Currently I work full time as a Laravel freelance developer, serving businesses over the word.
